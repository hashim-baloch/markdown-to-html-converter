# Markdown to HTML Converter

## The Raw-Dogged, No-Dependency Markdown Magic 🪄

Welcome to the **Markdown to HTML Converter**—a majestic piece of engineering that takes your glorious Markdown and spits out HTML like it’s going out of style. We did this **with absolutely zero dependencies**—that’s right, no bloated libraries, no unnecessary frameworks, just pure, unfiltered, hand-rolled JavaScript.

## Features (or Lack Thereof)

✅ Converts Markdown to HTML… mostly.  
✅ Minimalistic and lightweight—because bloat is a crime.  
✅ A **Download HTML** button that may or may not work as intended.  
✅ No dependencies—did we mention that already?  
✅ Runs purely in the browser, because who needs backend logic anyway?

🚧 **Planned Improvements:** More accurate Markdown parsing (because sometimes, it just vibes and does its own thing).

## How to Use This Absolute Masterpiece 🏆

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser (or the worst one, we don’t judge).
2. Type Markdown into the fancy textarea.
3. Watch in awe as it **magically** transforms into HTML in real-time.
4. Click the **Download HTML** button, because who doesn’t love downloading files?

## Installation & Setup (Just Kidding, There's Nothing to Install) 🚀

Since we’re proudly running this operation **dependency-free**, there’s no need for npm installs, build steps, or fancy CLI tools. Just open the HTML file and you’re good to go.

## Testing Results 📊

At the moment, we proudly pass **23 out of 33** tests. That’s a solid **C-grade effort**, and we are fully embracing it. Improvements? Yeah, sure, maybe later. But for now, we’re calling it **"feature-rich" in a fun and quirky way.**

## Contributing 🤷

You’re more than welcome to fork this project, but honestly, we love it in its pure, slightly broken form. If you must contribute, try not to ruin the minimalist charm.

## License 📜

No clue. Just don’t blame us if this thing breaks your computer or steals your lunch.
